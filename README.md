# behavior-map-tutorial
A tutorial and code for running unsupervised behavioral analysis on various animal pose data

You have built a rig for collecting recordings of animal behavior of interest, tracked centroids of lone and multiple animals, used deep networks to label limb and body parts, and have learned supervised and unsupervised analysis techniques to apply to this data. 

Letâ€™s get our hands dirty and, starting with some example data, or modify with your own data!



Where is the starting point? Do you have images, tracked joints, or some other representation of the behavior of one or more animals over time? 


Getting the data to an appropriate postural+dynamic representation that is useful for your biological question: compressing the high-dimensional data into a description that captures the variance that you are interested in explaining and characterizing.
