# behavior-map-tutorial
A tutorial and code for running unsupervised behavioral analysis on various animal pose data

You have built a rig for collecting recordings of animal behavior of interest, tracked centroids of lone and multiple animals, used deep networks to label limb and body parts, and have learned supervised and unsupervised analysis techniques to apply to this data. 

Letâ€™s get our hands dirty and, starting with some example data, or modify with your own data!
